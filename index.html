            <p> Are you tired of endless lists of tasks that you, with good intentions, entered in your existing
                todo-application?
                Let's be honest, most of the tasks in your todo-lists will never be completed! Many of them will become obsolete
                or less important over time.

            <h3>What is the Pomodoro technique?</h3>
            <p>
                The Pomodoro technique relies on the fact that 25 minutes is the perfect time period for performing focused, uninterrupted work.
                It's short enough to be able to completely focus on a task and long enough to actually achieve something.
            </p>
            <p>During a Pomodoro, you should not let anything else distract you. You should not check your email, your Twitter feed
                or whatever. Ideally, you should also dismiss any interruptions that may occur, like incoming phone calls, collegues coming over
                wanting to discuss something etc. Instead,
                kindly tell them that you will get back to them shortly. (Shortly is when your 25 minute Pomodoro has ended). </p>
            <p>The Pomodoro
                technique also recommends taking at least a five minutes break between the Pomodoros. The break may also be longer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <mark>Pomodoros are the perfect fit for making progress when studying, programming, designing </mark>or doing whatever solo work that
                needs your full attention, but doesn't involve much collaboration with other people.

                    <p>The name Pomodoro was inspired by the tomato shaped kitchen timer. (Pomodoro is italian for tomato)</p>

            <h3>What is GTDT?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>"Get Things Done Today"</strong> is a philosophy that focuses on the most important short term tasks and uses
                the Pomodoro technique to complete them.</p>
            <p>
                This philosophy challenges David Allen's time management method "Getting Things Done", which encourages
                its followers to manage every single task they can think of, short term and long term, and then hide the
                tasks that cannot be done in short term. </p>
            <p><strong>GTDT</strong> puts no focus at all on long term tasks.
                Instead, <strong>GTDT</strong> assumes that
                if some future task is important enough, it will attract your attention again anyway. If a future task
                turns out to be not-so-important, you will not think of it again and it should simply be forgotten.
            </p>


            <h3> Reference quotes:
            </h3>
            <blockquote class="small">
                <p> "Getting Things Done is a time-management method, described in a book of the same title by
                    productivity
                    consultant David Allen. It is often referred to as GTD. The GTD method rests on the idea of moving
                    planned
                    tasks and projects out of the mind by recording them externally and then breaking them into
                    actionable
                    work items.
                    This allows one to focus attention on taking action on tasks, instead of on recalling them."
