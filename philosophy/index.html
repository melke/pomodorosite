            <p> Are you tired of endless lists of tasks that you, with good intentions, entered in your existing
                todo-application?
                Let's be honest, most of the tasks in your todo-lists will never be completed! They may become obsolete
                or less important over time.
                Wouldn't it be great if you could focus on the tasks you need to do today?
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                If you want to get things done, you need to focus, but there are distractions everywhere. GTDT will help
                you focus on the tasks
                that you need to complete today!
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> In the morning, decide which tasks you <mark>really need to complete today</mark> and <mark>create a
                    task for each one</mark> in
                    <strong>GTDT</strong>. Don't create too many tasks, you need to focus, remember?
                </li>
                <li> During the day, open <strong>GTDT</strong>, select a task
                    and <mark>start a "pomodoro" (a 25 minute period of focused work)</mark>. If one 25-minute pomodoro is not enough
                    for
                    a specific
                    task, just restart the pomodoro.
                </li>

                <li> If you finish a pomodoro ahead of time, mark it complete and delete it
                    before
                    the 25 minutes run out.
                </li>
                <li> To be able to focus, you will need breaks, so remember to take breaks between
                    the pomodoros.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <strong>"Get Things Done Today"</strong> is a philosophy that focuses on the most important short term tasks.
                This philosophy challenges David Allen's time management method "Getting Things Done", which encourages
                its
                followers to manage every single task they can think of, short term and long term, and then hide the
                tasks that
                cannot be done in short term. <strong>GTDT</strong> puts no focus at all on long term tasks. Instead, <strong>GTDT</strong> assumes that
                if some
                long term task is important enough, it will come to your attention again anyway. If a long term task
                turns out
                to be not-so-important, you will not think of it again and it should simply be forgotten. Furthermore,
                <strong>GTDT</strong> encourages
                the use of the Pomodoro technique, as a tool to focus on completing the tasks as quick as possible.

            <blockquote class="small">
                <p> "Getting Things Done is a time-management method, described in a book of the same title by
                    productivity
                    consultant David Allen. It is often referred to as GTD. The GTD method rests on the idea of moving
                    planned
                    tasks and projects out of the mind by recording them externally and then breaking them into
                    actionable
                    work items.
                    This allows one to focus attention on taking action on tasks, instead of on recalling them."

                    "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late
                    1980s.
                    The technique
                    uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by
